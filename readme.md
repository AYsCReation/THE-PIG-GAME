# THE-PIG-GAME
I have created this Pig game by using HTML,CSS and javaScript, the player who scored 50 first will won the game.
When you click on thr roll button your dice will give you a number between 1 TO 6 and the number will keep adding on your bottom score card and as after using hold button the main score will will get into your main score area and the next player chance will come, but if before using hold button the number "1" have come to your dice,then your chance will be over without getting any score of that particular chance.
Use HOLD button for safe play otherwise all score will go away if "1" will come on your dice number.  play it for 2-3 times , then you will get the rules and better view of this game
